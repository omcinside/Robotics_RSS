To Do: 				08/10/2014 13:32

in Scan class: 
-IR-logic in methods: scan180, scan360, align, nearestAnomaly, lookleft,lookright, numAnomalies
-Image recognition in method: room


main method will go something like:

map.setBase(int baseNumber);

scan.scan360();
if(scan.numAnomalies>1) { //i.e. we have started in the middle but we want to start in a room
map.moveThroughDoor();}

scan.scan360(); 
if(scan.numAnomalies>1) {
printf("something is wrong with our anomaly detection method \n");
return;}

map.setStartingRoom(scan.room());
map.goHome();

return;


preferably we'll have some obstacle avoidance listener or something that can kick in but only last minute (and it will probably mess with the hard-coded path)
